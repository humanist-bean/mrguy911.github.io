              <h3>Tech Support Visit</h3>
              <p>Computers, printers, and phones have taken over our lives. That's why it's so frustrating when they just won't work! Other tech support companies are expensive and leave their customers out of the loop by using obscure technical jargon. Here at Geek on a bike we don't just solve your problems. We take pride in our ability to explain technical issues using laymans terms so next time you can fix it yourself.</p>
              <p>Pricing: $20 per hour + $20 Transportation fee</p>

          <h3>How it Works</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Our goal is to get you face to face with a geek as soon as possible.
            Geeks spend their days biking around Eugene from job to job.
            Customers can contact us 24/7 at our email and phone number.
            Once a customer contacts us we schedule an appointment at the customers convenience.
            For pressing technical problems we are available for same-day scheduling.
            Flexibility and efficiency are the pillars our business and we work fast.
            An example of this would be our website design. Typically, a website takes weeks or months to develop.
            Here at geek on a bike we design, develop, and launch your site in 2-3 days.
            Feel to reach out if you have any questions!
