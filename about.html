          <p>
            Technology has become a necessity in day to day life, for better or worse.
            That's why it can be so frustrating when it just won't work!
            My name is Alder and I am a computer science student. I offer handyman services
            for the modern world. After working a computer repair job and an office tech
            support job I realized something. There is no one out there to solve the common
            person's technical problems. Some large companies offer support for their specific
            services (such as internet and phone providers) but their support is limited to the scope of their
            companies technology. Furthermore, these technicians are expensive and schedule their appointments weeks
            to months ahead of time. Where are people supposed to go when they have silly little technical issues?
            No one wants to schedule a $200 appointment two weeks in advance just because their printer won't work.
            Humans aren't born with a silicon finger. Modern technology is new and alien to many of us.
            Yet, every business in today's day and age needs a website. Without one they risk being non-existant on the internet.
            This can be a matter of life or death to a business that relies on us phone touting folks for their revenue.
            That's where Geek on a bike comes in. Geek on a bike is an affordable tech support service. My goal is
            to break the barrier that prevents local businesses, artists, and individual from taking advantage of modern technology.
